## 📈 Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load `projectML.csv`  
   - Clean and preprocess text  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Train Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and LSTM models  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion matrix visualization
